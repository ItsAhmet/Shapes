# Shapes
******** for the calculation methods i included parameters which are not needed since they have access to instance variables AND outputs do not have unit labels *****************


Shapes Project

Directions: 
Create a new Java Project named “Shapes”
Create classes to calculate the following shape measurements. Each class should have appropriate instance variables and methods. (Note: unless otherwise directed, complete them in order.)
Create a tester class called Shapes which will collect user input for each measurement that a shape needs
Two of the prompts will be Scanners class and two will be Dialog Boxes.
All classes should have headings.
Be sure your display is neat, user friendly and error-free.
When displaying the results of your calculation, re-display the user input and then the result.
Code should be written using “best practice” programming style with white space & comments that aid a “reader” in understanding your code.
Round all results to 2 decimal places, label as units squared
Use the Math methods and concepts as appropriate (Math.pow, Math.PI, etc.)
Confirm your calculations with a reputable online resource. 


class Square:
  Instance variable: sidelength
  method: area = side(squared)
  Method: perimeter= side*4
class Circle:
  Instance variable: radius
  method: area = PI * radius^2
  method: diameter= radius*2
class Triangle:
  Instance variables: base, height
  method: area = ½ * base * height
 class Trapezoid:
  Instance variables: baseA, baseB, height
  method: area = ( ½ * (baseA + baseB)) * height  
class Shape:
  Uses scanner twice and dialog box twice to gather information for each type of shape
  All displays should appear in this class


Shapes Challenge

Directions: 
After completing all the previous classes, complete the following challenges.

Challenge 1: Calculate the volume of a right cylinder. (class Cylinder)
Challenge 2: Calculate the surface area of a right cylinder. (class Cylinder)
Challenge 3: Calculate the area of a right circular cone. (class Cone)
Challenge 4: Calculate the volume of a right circular cone. (class Cone)

Shapes Rubric
14 Points
4.0 = each class contains the correct instance variables and methods
2.0 = correct results are displayed, including the original inputs
1.0 = math methods used correctly in calculations
1.0 = appropriate use of printf/String.format (rounding)
1.0 = prompts are user friendly and clear
1.0 = miscellaneous points (ex: not labeling units)
0.5 = headings are neat and clear (see submission guidelines)
0.5 = alignment is user friendly
0.5 = comments add to the reader’s understanding of the code
0.5 = good use of white space; clean programming style
0.5 = all spelling is correct
Extra credit 0.5 for each challenge completed correctly
